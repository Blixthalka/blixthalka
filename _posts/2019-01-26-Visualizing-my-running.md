title: Visualizing my running
---
Recently I stumbled on [this](https://dontpaniclabs.com/blog/post/2017/07/27/mapbox-visualizing-workout-activities/) blog post about visualizing workout activites. 
I thought this was really cool, so I figured I try on my own. 
So I immediately downloaded all my runs and rides from Strava and made my own visualizations.
Here are the results.
