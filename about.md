Hello! I'm a 24 year old from the northern parts of Sweden, currently located in Stockholm.
I enjoy developing applications, learning new things and running (especially with a map in my hand).   

Currently I'm working with payments and writing code in Java at a quite small company.
Since the company is small I get to do a lot of different stuff at work, all the way from the database to the front end, which I really enjoy.
Before this job I was working with encoders and decoders sending audio and video over IP networks, mostly working in C/C++.
