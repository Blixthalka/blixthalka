Hello! I'm a 24 year old from the northern part of Sweden, currently located in Stockholm. I enjoy developing applications, learning new things and running (especially with a map in my hand).   

### Experience

_PJ Paymenttech - Java Developer - 7 months (current position)_ 

Currently I'm working with direct bank payments. 


_Intinor - Junior Developer - 1 year_  
At Intinor I got my first experience working as a software developer. I also attained knowledge about transmission of audio and video over IP networks. During my stay here my biggest task was to develop an ember+ interface, however some bug fixing was also part of my duties. I mainly worked in C/C++, but also got to use my knowledge in Bash and Perl. Throughout the summer I worked full time and part time during the autumn alongside my studies. When spring arrived I started writing my master thesis here.


_Ume√• University - Student - 5 years_
