Yo, everyone. What is up?

### Experience


###### PJ Paymenttech - Java Developer - 7 months (current position) 


###### Intinor - Junior Developer - _1 year_



At Intinor I got my first experience working as a software developer. I also attained knowledge about transmission of audio and video over IP networks. During my stay here my biggest task was to develop an ember+ interface, however some bug fixing was also part of my duties. I mainly worked in C/C++, but also got to use my knowledge in Bash and Perl. Throughout the summer I worked full time and part time during the autumn alongside my studies. When spring arrived I started writing my master thesis here.


> UmeÃ¥ University, _5 years_
